**Proper use of aliases** in SQL is an important practice for writing clear and maintainable queries, especially in complex database operations. Here are some relevant pointers regarding the use of aliases:

1. **Use Aliases for Clarity and Readability**
   > Aliases are particularly useful in queries with joins or subqueries where tables or subqueries are referenced multiple times.  

   > Assign meaningful alias names that clearly indicate the role or content of the table or column.

2. **Column Aliases for Better Output Formatting**
  > Use column aliases to provide more readable and descriptive column names in the output of your query.  

   > This is especially useful when the original column names are cryptic, derived from calculations, or when you want to present the data in a specific format to end users.


3. **Table Aliases to Simplify Query Writing**
   > When working with joins, especially involving multiple tables or subqueries, use table aliases to shorten and simplify your SQL syntax.
   
   > This reduces the need to repeatedly write the full table name, making the query easier to read and write.

4. **Aliases in Complex Queries**
   > In complex queries involving multiple levels of subqueries, aliases help keep track of each level and make the query more navigable.
   
   > They are essential when the same table is joined to itself (self-join) for clarity in distinguishing different instances of the table.

5. **Consistency in Aliasing**
   > Be consistent in the use of aliases throughout the query. Once you assign an alias to a table or column, use that alias exclusively for all references to it in that query.  
   
   > This consistency is key to avoiding confusion and potential errors in the query.

6. **Using Aliases in Aggregate and Window Functions**
   > When using aggregate functions (like SUM, COUNT, etc.) or window functions, aliases provide a way to reference the computed columns easily in the query or in the ORDER BY clause.

7. **Avoiding Ambiguity**
   > Use aliases to avoid ambiguity, especially when different tables in a join have columns with the same name.
   
   > This practice is crucial for ensuring that the SQL engine correctly understands which column is being referenced.

8. **Mandatory Aliases in Certain Scenarios**
   > In some SQL operations, like when using subqueries in the FROM clause, assigning an alias is mandatory. Ensure compliance with these requirements to avoid syntax errors.

9. **Formatting and Naming Conventions**
   > Follow a consistent naming convention and format for aliases across your queries and within your team or organization to maintain uniformity.

10. **Aliasing and SQL Variants**
   > Be aware that syntax for aliasing can vary slightly between different SQL variants (like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server). Ensure you're using the correct syntax for your specific database system.

Incorporating these pointers about aliases into SQL practices will enhance the readability, maintainability, and overall quality of the database queries. They are particularly beneficial in complex queries and in scenarios where presentation and clarity of the output are critical.
