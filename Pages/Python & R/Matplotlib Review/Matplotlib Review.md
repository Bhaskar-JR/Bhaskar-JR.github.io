# Matplotlib Review document  
Aug-2021  


Excited to share my [learnings on Matplotlib](Matplotlib_Review_2021_Complete.pdf). ðŸ“ˆðŸ“ŠðŸ“‰  

Hope this can be a value add to the python users and those who are at the crossroads in Excel or R and looking to foray into Python for data analysis.  

Let me also add more context.  

Matplotlib is the core library for data visualization in Python. I had majorly been a user of Seaborn and Pandas plotting in Python ecosystem. In R, ggplot2 has been the go-to library amply supported with tidyr for data wrangling operations. Within this context, Matplotlib seemed to be verbose, code heavy and aesthetically unappealing.  

However, in trying to make tweaks in the plots through Seaborn and Pandas, it is inevitable to come across Matplotlib. So, thus began my journey to understand Matplotlib and the outcome is a Matplotlib Review document spanning 350+ Pages.  

## Teaser of the Matplotlib Review doc

## Diving into Matplotlib  

The initial reservations I had towards the verbose code scripts in matplotlib gave away to appreciation of the inherent philosophy in the Matplotlib API. For beginners in Matplotlib, instead of straight away deep diving into the sea of code, a more "perspective redefining experience" can be gained by reading and understanding the architecture of Matplotlib API first. And then following it up with the Anatomy of a figure and the Artist tutorial.

The sense of empowerment is exhilarating from the **finely grained control with precision** over each and every aspect of the plot that matplotlib gives you. The code does not seem verbose once threshold understanding is attained. Instead the code seems to be merely boilerplate. On the finely grained control aspect and that too at a granular level, it is not something that one can get in drag & drop and point & click based graphics.

I have tried to structure the progression of topics in a systematic manner. A concerted effort has been made to include examples with code snippets that can serve as a go to reference guide.

So, without much ado, I am excited to share this compendium of my personal learnings on Matplotlib and plotting in python.

## Epilogue  

Do feel free to ping me incase of any queries or suggestions/feedback.  
Also, will revisit and do document updation hopefully in later half of 2022.
