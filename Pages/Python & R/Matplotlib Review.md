# Matplotlib Review document  
Aug-2021  


Excited to share my learnings on Matplotlib. ðŸ“ˆðŸ“ŠðŸ“‰  

Hope this can be a value add to the python users and those who are at the crossroads in Excel or R and looking to foray into Python for data analysis.  

Let me also add more context.  

Matplotlib is the core library for data visualization in Python. I had majorly been a user of Seaborn and Pandas plotting in Python ecosystem. In R, ggplot2 has been the go-to library amply supported with tidyr for data wrangling operations. Within this context, Matplotlib seemed to be verbose, code heavy and aesthetically unappealing.  

However, in trying to make tweaks in the plots through Seaborn and Pandas, it is inevitable to come across Matplotlib. So, thus began my journey to understand Matplotlib and the outcome is this Matplotlib Review document spanning 350+ Pages.  

The video showcases excerpts from the pdf. Pardon the post processing video quality in linkedin (Check HD version in comments thread). Meanwhile, the pdf download links are in the comments thread.
