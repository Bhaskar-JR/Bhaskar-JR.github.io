# Dropdown Multiple Selection

While Excel is ubiquitous in our professional and personal lives, we do come across its limitations once in a while. The most recent one being "Excel in-cell dropdown does not give you the option of multiple selection".  

Let's take a simple use-case. Consider you have multiple rows of data out of which you want to select only few rows and create a scatter plot. I can select and gather the rows manually by copy and paste. And then create the chart. However, it can easily become tedious to repeat it every-time even for a minor inspection. I would rather love to simply select the rows using a "dropdown list" to get the output. And that's it in a matter of few clicks without the entire rigmarole.  

So, I took up this challenge to create a solution with Excel VBA. Excel VBA programming is indeed very powerful. Anything and everything is possible in it. Although it may not be the best alternative every time, it perfectly suits the current use-case.  


I have attached a video snippet of the proposed solution. It should work in both Windows and Mac. Note I had to avoid userforms as it is incompatible in Mac. I am sharing file in the comments. Let me know if you have some interesting take or suggestions on the proposed solution.
