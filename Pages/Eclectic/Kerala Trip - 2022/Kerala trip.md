# Kalsubai Trek - 2018  

Story goes that many many years a woman named Kalsubai was forced to leave her village. She chose to live in this mountain and made it her home till the last breath. A temple of Mata Kalsubai is placed at the mountain top.  

## Motivation for the Trek :  

I had trekked Kalsubai peak two yrs back but it was all surrounded with clouds. This time I hoped to witness all of the western ghats in its sublime glory from Maharashtra's highest point.  

## The Trek of 3.5 hrs during ascent :  

Quite lengthy though. It rained and we seemed to be endlessly walking. There were rocks, pebbles filled slippery earthy pathways marked by footsteps of previous trekkers. Numerous soles detached from their shoes could be found abandoned. Was panting but intermittent breaks for lemon water kept the body rehydrated. There were people queuing to climb the iron ladders ledged to the sloping cliffs. A narrow area between the railings had two rows of people one going up and the other down. Eventually, We reached the top in 3.5 hours amidst clouds, mist, rains and chilly winds.  

Spent some time at the top before descending in another 4 hrs as the daylight slowly started giving way to darkness. Started back towards Mumbai from base village at around 8 pm. Reached home by 12:30 with every part of body aching.
