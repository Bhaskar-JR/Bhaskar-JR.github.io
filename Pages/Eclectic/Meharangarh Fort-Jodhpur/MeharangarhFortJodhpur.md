# Meharangarh Fort, Jodhpur  

## Towards second gate  

On way upwards to Second gate of Mehrangarh Fort, which is at perpendicular to the main pathway. This was strategically to prevent elephants from getting momentum while striking at the fort gates. Further, there were iron spikes on the gate making the fort impregnable.
