Amber Vermont in Mussourie is a great place to stay, perched a little afar at 10-15 mins drive from the bustling Mall Road. With splendid views to offer, this is a well constructed bungalow kind of building with white balustrades in immaculate white colour. As you go out through arched entrances, you are greeted by flower pots hanging along the walls. While your feet are welcomed by gravel and stone filled pathways. If you pay close attention there is also a reclining Buddha statue in one of the corners near the door entrance. In the morning, as you take a stroll, you can hear the birds chirruping, a few insects making their mysterious sounds. Hours could pass away in the tranquil filled atmosphere of this place. Indeed a perfect place to unwind.
