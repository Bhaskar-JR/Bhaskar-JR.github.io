## Off to Sandhan Valley  

Headed off to Sandhan Valley Trekking as a sign off to the year 2018.  

It was my first time experience with the canyons.   
Set in the Sahyadris of western ghats, we had started early in morning from the base village. The next 8-10 hours would take us through splendid views, varied challenges in making our way through the rocky terrain. What a thrilling experience !!
