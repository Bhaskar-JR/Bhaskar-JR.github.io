## Credit screening (UCI)
This dataset has been downloaded from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.
<https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Credit+Approval>

This dataset is regarding credit card applications.
The target variable/label is whether the application has been granted credit or not.
All attribute names and values have been changed to meaningless symbols to protect confidentiality of the data.

The objective is here to build a classifier model to give **binary output** based on the input attributes.  
The dataset is balanced.

We have spot-checked multiple classifier algorithms using both simple train/test split as well as k fold cross validation.
Accuracy was chosen as the evaluation metric as the dataset is balanced. Two algorithms were shortlisted and taken forward for hyper-parameter tuning.

## Sales Transaction Weekly of 800 products (UCI)

This dataset has been downloaded from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.  
<https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00396/>
<https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Sales_Transactions_Dataset_Weekly>  


We have the sales quantity of 811 products over a period of 52 weeks.  
The available information can be used for two kinds of problems.

- Firstly, we can create a time series forecasting model to predict the sales qty for next week.
- Secondly, we can build a clustering model to identify natural groupings of the product based on the weekly sales pattern.
